A LaTeX Mastodon client.

To run:

1) Obtain a client secret and access token. It is assumed you know how to do this.
2) Run the client like: python3 latexclient.py <instance url> <client secret file> <access token file>
3) Point your favourite pdf reader to client.pdf and set it to auto-refresh. I recommend okular.

(Do not actually run this. It's bad, a joke, probably insecure)
